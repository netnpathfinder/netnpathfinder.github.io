<p>Our lodge has been through some ups and downs over the years, but we are hoping to pour our hearts into it and see it grow to host a number of games across various venues in the area. We currently host games at Nerd HQ in Johnson City, TN.</p>

<p>We currently host games on Saturdays from 6:30PM-11:30PM EST. Sometimes our games run a little later, though we strive to prevent that from happening in order to respect everyone's time. If you are interested in signing up for a game, create an account on <a class="fa-link" href="https://warhorn.net/events/erwin-pfs">WarHorn.net</a> and Register for games at our lodge in order to sign up. We can help you get started from there.</p>
