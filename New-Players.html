<h1>20. Getting Started with PFS as a Player</h1>
<p>Have you been wanting to play a TTRPG, but haven't had the time to commit to weekly games? Looking for something to scratch that roleplaying itch?</p>
<p>Well let me present you with Pathfinder Society Organized Play, or PFS. In PFS you can sign up for a game that is scheduled and show up with any character in that level tier.</p>
<p>For Example:
<ul>
<li>Saturday, September 21st, 2019 there is a game at Nerd HQ for players level 1-4.</li>
<li>You have a character that is level 2 because you have played in three sessions already.</li>
<li>All you have to do is sign in on WarHorn.net and reserve a spot and you show up and play.</li>
<li>After the session you will receive a chronicle sheet with XP and Items/Gold from the GM that you add to your character.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>21. How do I sign up for a Paizo account?</h2>
<p>First you need a Paizo.com account. Head on over to <a href="https://paizo.com/">Paizo's Website</a> and create an account by clicking Sign in in the Header. This will take you to a login page, but just click "Create New Account" to register.</p>
<p>Next, you will have to confirm your email address through the link sent to you. Then you will set a password.</p>
<p>Now that your account is created you need to join Organized Play. Go to "My Account" and then click "Join Organized Play".</p>
<p>Here you will get two options. Either enter a number provided to you by the GM of your first session (Assuming we are organized and doing our jobs right), OR you can get a new number. Either way you will then be signed up for Organized play and can view all of your sessions and have the number you need in order to report having played in games with us!</p>

<h2>22. How do I sign up for a WarHorn account?</h2>
<p>In order to hold your spot in a game at one of our locations, you need a WarHorn.Net account. Here are the instructions to get one.</p>
<p>First, head over to <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/erwin-pfs">The NETN Pathfinder Society Warhorn Group</a>. Here you can click "Sign Up" in the header.</p>
<p>You will again need an email address, name and password. You will also need to confirm your address again via a link sent to your email.</p>
<p>Finally you can then return to <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/erwin-pfs">The NETN Pathfinder Society Warhorn Group</a> and click "Register." Once added by an admin, you will be able to reserve your spot on WarHorn.net and view the other players and GMs running games</p>
<p>Last but not least, we ask that you try to put in your class and level so that we can prepare the session accordingly.</p>

<h2>23. What do I need to bring when I come play a Pathfinder Society game</h2>
<p>It is best that you remember to bring the following things to a PFS game
<ol>
<li>Your character sheet</li>
<li>Your past chronicle sheets (to prove what games you have played in case we need to know)</li>
<li>A set of polyhedral dice. You know d20, 2d10, d4, d8, d6, d12. If you don't have any, then <a href="https://nerdhqjc.com/">Nerd HQ</a> has some you can purchase!</li>
<li>Your clean self. (Come on guys, we are all adults and should bathe regularly. No one wants to be cramped at a table with a smelly nerd &#128540)</li>
<li>Your best roleplaying attitude and a friendly face!</li>
</ol></p>
